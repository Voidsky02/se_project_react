# What to Wear - React Project

## This website takes weather data from a specified location, and reccommends outfits based on the climate.

## Technologies and Techniques:

- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- React

- I used mostly react components to help organize my code for readabilty, and React Routes for setting up the different pages depending on where the end user was navigating. Html and css for all structure and styling, and JS for the API calls and overall utilities.
